WARNING: Use of this library is strongly discouraged. Providing a library that essentially disables or bypasses a major facet of inter-application communication security, while convenient for development, also makes it easy for developers to deploy insecure applications to production. Platforms like Cloud Foundry have made it easier to centralize SSL certificate management at an operations level, eliminating any need for a library like this. As such, this library is not being actively maintained and there are no plans to publish further releases of the library.

`CloudFoundryCertificateTruster` will download certificates
and add them to the JVM truststore at the earliest possible time.

== Dependencies

Include the dependency in your Spring Boot project to activate the certificate truster.

=== Maven

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.pivotal.spring.cloud</groupId>
  <artifactId>cloudfoundry-certificate-truster</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.1.RELEASE</version>
</dependency>
----

=== Gradle

[source,groovy]
----
compile("io.pivotal.spring.cloud:cloudfoundry-certificate-truster:1.0.1.RELEASE")
----

== Usage

Certificates can be specified by either or both of the following environment variables:

----
CF_TARGET=https://api.my-cf-domain.com
----

This will cause `CloudFoundryCertificateTruster` to download the certificate at api.my-cf-domain.com:443 and add
it to the JVM's truststore.

----
TRUST_CERTS=api.foo.com,api.bar.com:8443
----

This will cause `CloudFoundryCertificateTruster` to download the certificates at api.foo.com:443 and api.bar.com:8443 and add them to the JVM's truststore. You can specify one or more comma separated hostnames, optionally with a port.

NOTE: The timeout for certificate download is 5 seconds. If any errors occur, they are printed to System.err.

== Build
